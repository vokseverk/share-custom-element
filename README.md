# Share Custom Element

This is a [Custom Element][CE] to handle sharing a URL using either the [Web Share API][WSA] or,
if that's not available, a couple of default services' share URLs, so as to not have to
use their ginormous JS-embeds, that preload a multitude of scripts on *every.single.page*
using them.

The goal is to be able to add this to a page:

```html
<share-link label="Share"><a href="https://test.com/path/to/page">Link to this page</a></share-link>
```

â€” and have it render a button that triggers the **Web Share API**'s `share()` method,
when clicked (the Web Share API requires [transient activation][TACT]).

If the browser doesn't support the Web Share API, we should get a couple of links to
**Facebook**'s and *maybe* **X**'s public share URLs, along with a generic "Copy link"
button.

If the browser doesn't support custom elements, the link inside should be rendered. (This would
have to be manually specified by your CMS - *please don't use JavaScript to do this!* - this
is the "last resort" case where if all else fails, at least we have a link we can manually copy).
