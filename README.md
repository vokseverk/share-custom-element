# JavaScript Component Template

This is a starter project for building a JavaScript component.

The Jasmine test library comes pre-installed, so there's really no excuse for
not having any tests :)

See the included `color.js` and its accompanying `ColorSpec.js` file for how to get
started.

If you're using [Panic](https://panic.com)'s [Nova](https://nova.app) editor,
you can hit <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to run the tests.
